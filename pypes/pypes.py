""" The Pypes micro-framework offers you to wrap your data processing functions
    with `PypeSegment`s, that you can compose to `PypeLine`s. In return you get
    a conveniently set up logging facility, and some structure in your data flow.

    It also adds a layer of reusability to your code, but that still depends
    a great deal on how you design the inputs and outputs of your process steps.

    The framework tries to stay minimal, also in terms of what you need to know
    about it. Currently it mainly consists of two classes and one function:
        * PypeSegment:
            Inheriting from this class and defining a process method is all it
            takes. You can optionally define check_inputs, to validate your
            inputs before processing.

        * PypeLine:
            A chain of PypeSegments. It can be used as a Segment itself.

        * wrap_for_next_segment():
            Call this, how you would call the next processing function and
            return its result. It will create a wrapper object to ship the
            results/arguments through the PypeLine code.

    Logging can be configured through a bunch of environment variables:

        LOGLEVEL:
            the general loglevel
        STDOUT_LOGLEVEL:
            the loglevel of the console output
        <LEVELNAME>_LOGFILE:
            if such a variable is defined,
            a filelogger for that level is created
            and added to the logging facility

        If you run your_program.py like this:

        STDOUT_LOGLEVEL=debug LOGLEVEL=info ERROR_LOGFILE=error.log your_program.py

        Then error.log will contain all log messages of level ERROR and higher.
        On stdout you will still just see all messages from INFO on, since the
        general LOGLEVEL is set to this level, and thus messages with a lower
        loglevel will just not be handled. This is also why you should avoid
        formatting log messages right away, but let the logging facility take
        care of that instead, because then you can save the performance cost of
        formatting large data structures (say on loglevel DEBUG), by setting
        the general loglevel (when not debugging) to some higher level.
